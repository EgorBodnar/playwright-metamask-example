# Automation QA Framework Demo. 
#### Playwright interacting wit Metamask Chrome extension

The concept of a Framework as a black box for CI/CD systems is applied here. As a result, it can be integrated as a submodule to the main project or as a repository in a MonoRepo. Tests can then be executed through an isolated environment, which is already preconfigured in the Dockerfile.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1.  **Install Node.js**: To run this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2.  **Install Yarn**: Yarn is a package manager for Node.js that we'll use to manage the project's dependencies. You can install Yarn by following the instructions on the official website: [https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/).

3.  Create a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env. This new file will store the actual values for the environment variables.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn e2e:test
```

The report will be automatically generated after the automated tests have been executed.

**If you want to run the tests in Docker, simply build the image and run it. The framework will return an error code 1 if there were any test failures. This makes it easy to indicate the success or failure status of the test run. By using extensions in the input scripts, you can run various types of testing while controlling them through environment variables.**
